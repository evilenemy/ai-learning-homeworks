# 1. What is the difference between the continue and break statements in Python?
# 2. Can you explain the difference between for loop and while loop?
# 3. How would you implement a nested for loop system? Provide an example

# 1. "continue" skip after code and next to next iteration, "break" stops loop
# 2. for loop works until iterable object will have no next object, while lopp works until condition would be False

# 3
# for i in range(10):
#     for j in range(i, 10):
#         print(i, j)
